# YOU DID NOT CHOOSE THIS PLANET, IT CHOSE YOU

Egypt faces many challenges on a daily basis. Year after year, it becomes more vulnerable to change—What is meant by change, is the change of climate. <!-- more -->The challenge is closer to be a threat specially if we didn't take an action to save the environment. Sustainability is the main target nowadays, we have to go for it depending on everything we have (money, manpower, working areas, etc...). Sooner or later, the threats we face as Egyptians will be unendurable.

For every plastic you throw in the water. For every waste that has been disposed without thinking how this will affect the Earth. If you do not believe me, start walking down the streets and you will know. Take a minute and search for climate change and the first thing you will see trending is that climate change will end civilization very soon!

By that, it is not meant that Earth will be destroyed tomorrow or any time soon. Sure, it will take time. But before that happens, it is you who will be destroyed. Potentially you will suffer from a lot of diseases; many of them are overcome for now, but they will reach a level that no one will ever endure! A lot of work is being done in this field, and recently there are many public figures showing themselves and talking to all of the politicians and firms.

And yet, here you are... The survival of Earth, the place that gets hotter every decade. Every decade emissions increase and in a century your grandchildren may suffer from respiratory diseases and their children will potentially have lung cancer.

# OUR GOAL TO SUSTAINABILITY

The challenges increase in according to the growing popularity and hence the increased demand for food and transportation or just for living.

As a team we managed to carve the future of not only the green energy, but also sustainability and the rise of artificial intelligence under the lens of sustainability. 

A year ago, we built our first electric vehicle and competed in Shell Eco-Marathon competition with a target of not only creating a green car but also efficient electric consumption.
