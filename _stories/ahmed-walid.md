Ahmed Walid joined the team in 2018, at the very beginning by joining the team's first competition "EVER18" (A regional competition in Egypt, 2018). He was leading the chassis team and his first time, he successfully designed and manufactured a chassis that weighed a total of 85Kg. That was the first car ART00 (the first designed car that weighed 400kg) in which you will see the full design below.

Walid also joined the team in his first global competition, Shell Eco-Marathon 2019. He managed this time to decrease the weight of the chassis and successfully reached a full design that weighs 35Kg. Despite the great reduction in weight, the chassis was absolutely more rigid and reliable.
Going through this year, the team successfully competed in SEM19 at the International Circuit in Malaysia and passed the Technical and Safety Inspections of the competition.
Walid managed to change his role next year, so he worked so hard to transfer all his experience to his fellow teammates.

Walid's new role in SEM20 (Shell Eco-Marathon 2020) was the suspension of the car, it was challenging for him and the whole team, as it was the first time to be designed and will be introduced to ART03 (The 4th designed car by the team that weighed 150Kg). He was a great leader and a successful team member.
