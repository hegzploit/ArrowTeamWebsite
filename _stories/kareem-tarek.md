Kareem Tarek joined the team and competed in EVER19 (Local Competition in Egypt, where we competed with ART02) and his role was the Chassis of the vehicle, together with the other teammates. He successfully brought a full design and manufacturing of full aluminum chassis that weighed 45Kg. It took him and his team a lot of work to come up with a good finish that year. In the second (the current) season, he is giving a great contribution to the chassis of the vehicle (ART03 which is meant to be competing in SEM20, and his graduation project) and this year he brought (together with his fellow teammate Ahmed Waleed) a chassis that weighs 20Kg, bringing the weight down to more than half of the previous season. Also, he is a member of the more advanced and lighter in the weight steering system (wire steering) that will involve an autonomous controlling motor for the lane-keep assist that ART03 will be providing.

Kareem didn't just contribute technically in the team, he is also the scrutineering leader as he is responsible for bringing a car that defines all the rules of the competition and makes the team able to pass the technical inspection at Shell Eco-Marathon.
