Samer Khaled was one of the first very promising team members that ever joined the team at the early beginning. He was dedicated to the mechanical parts of the car. 
His role at first was the Wheel Assembly of the car (ART00, the first fully designed car). At that very first competition, he had to come up with a design for the tires assembly with the car's chassis. He worked together with his team and successfully brought a full design that has no failures and makes the car move at a speed of 40Km/hr.

His role wasn't only the wheel assembly, but also the whole assembly of the car.

Samer's contribution in 2019 was very special, he brought a full year of experience to ART01 in absolutely each and every part of the car especially the wheel assembly. That time we reached the manufacturing of our very first car and competed in Shell Eco-Marathon 2019. From our first contribution, we went to Malaysia at the International Circuit and passed the Shell Eco-Marathon technical and safety inspections.

Samer keeps on surprising the team with his innovative, out of the box solutions and unique skills.

In Shell Eco-Marathon 2020, he is leading the mechanical team and is responsible for the car's transmission (The whole system from the electric motor to the wheels) together with the aerodynamics and the body of the vehicle. 
SEM20 is his third contribution with the team, and throughout all the years, he gained a lot of technical and communication experiences that he proudly gave to all the future generations.
