Ahmed Yamani joined the team earlier in 2019 and his role was the digital marketing of the team, he was managing the social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and even our LinkedIn page. He made a tremendous work that year and he was doing his best, not only in his part, but also helped the team in different technical work during the manufacturing of ART01 (Shell Eco-Marathon 2019 car). That is when he earned the golden team member title, for all the passion and support he gave to the team at that time.

Ahmed Yamani has a different role in 2020 as he is contributing to the self-driving part of the vehicle. Trying to come up with something that will be new and innovative, along with all the new changes that will be made in ART03 that will make it different.
