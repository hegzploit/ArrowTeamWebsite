Rehab joined the team in 2018. From day one, she was in the team. She joined the first competition EVER18 (the regional competition in Egypt) and her role was the chassis of the vehicle, together with her teammate Ahmed Walid.
Despite also contributing to the manufacturing of different vehicle parts, her contribution wasn't only to the technical aspects of the vehicle but the team required many different jobs to finish the tasks needed.

Rehab's role in the second competition (SEM19) was something bigger; the interiors and ergonomics of the car. She learned how to make every little detail in the car that is responsible for the comfort of the driver's safety.

By the time this competition ended, she earned the title of golden member of the team (more about that at the end of the article).
Rehab also joined EVER19 (third competition for the team) and her role this time was something different; the body and aerodynamics of the vehicle, which is something she is really passionate about, as this shapes the car. She also joined the Shell NXplorers, the innovative educational programme that introduces complex and creative thinking needed to bring about positive change.

This season, in SEM20, she is giving her accumulated experience in the body and learning something new, as she is contributing to the powertrain of the car.

She earned the golden member title in 2019 because of her tremendous effort and support for the team in technical aspects and giving her experience for the new team members and we are expecting more next year.
