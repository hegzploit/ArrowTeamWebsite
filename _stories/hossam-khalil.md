Hossam joined the team late in 2018, he was chosen because of his very promising work and he was happy to contribute in ART01 (The car that competed in Shell Eco-Marathon 2019—Team's second car) by giving his efforts in the car's powertrain. That year, the team was introduced to a new and very challenging task. Which was to design the vehicle powertrain from scratch. From the car's modeling to designing the motor driver.

Hossam showed that year a tremendous effort; he is talented in what he does and a hard worker in what he is working on. The team successfully brought a full design for an electric motor driver and with that, we were ready for the season—SEM19. In 2019, the team made it to the International Circuit in Malaysia to compete with the teams from all over Asia. Also broke a record of competing for the first time and passing the technical and safety inspections of the competition.

Later in 2019, the team was going through his fourth contribution and building ART03 in order to compete in SEM20. The team was facing many challenges that weren't only in the technical terms, but also regarding the funding of the whole project. So, we started working on ART03 a bit earlier than usual and managed to get sponsors. Hossam helped the team a lot in terms of technical presentations, giving the team a great opportunity in meeting up with Brightskies company and making a partnership with them in building ART03. 

Hossam's role in ART03 was to lead the powertrain team in building a full design for a brushless motor driver and this is considered as a great leap forward in this field as we have been working on a brushed DC motor in the previous car (ART01).

Hossam has a great presentation and technical skills, that made him a very valuable member in the team. All the success is awaiting him!
