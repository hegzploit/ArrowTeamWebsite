Mohamed Mesbah joined the team and competed in the very first competition, EVER18. His role was the circuits and wiring of the car (ART00). He showed tremendous effort and continued growth in his communication and technical skills. He successfully brought a full design for the vehicle circuitry that year, together with his other teammates

Mesbah's second contribution was in SEM19, he had an accumulated experience that year and that made him take the lead and become responsible for the embedded and wiring team. 
That year, the team brought a very successful design and for the first time and from the first time, we were able to compete in "Shell Eco-Marathonâ€”SEM19" global competition by passing the technical phases of the competition and went to Malaysia to compete with 100 other teams from around the world at the International Circuit.

In 2019, he also joined the team at the (Shell Imagine the Future) competition that aimed at providing plausible scenarios (in the form of presentations) with alternative views of the future. The team went through the semi-finals that year and showed a great progress for the first in that type of competitions.

SEM20 was his fourth contribution with the team, by going through many technical and non-technical roles, he managed to shift a little and change his role to be in the car's electric powertrain and the monitoring systems related. That year is different as he will be graduating and with that, he is giving all his power to not only learn but to give what he learned to the next generations. He also made many efforts with the number one challenge of the 2020 season, which is to get sponsors for the project; and he succeeded in providing a great opportunity with brightskies company (the premier provider of high-quality services in the field of Automotive Services).
