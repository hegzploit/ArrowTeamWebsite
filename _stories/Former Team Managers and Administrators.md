# Ahmed Saber
He is “work hard in silence and make your work make the noise” type of person. Ahmed Saber supported the team for a couple of years, starting with EVER18  (regional electric vehicle competition in Egypt)  where he joined the team to handle the cost issues of the whole project and his unforgettable support that year with the manufacturing of the car.
In the second year, he was team administrator and also the leader of the vehicle interiors. Together with his teammate Rehab Rozeik, they brought an efficient, light in weight interior design for ART01 that later competed in Shell Eco-Marathon 2019 that was held in the international circuit in Malaysia.
