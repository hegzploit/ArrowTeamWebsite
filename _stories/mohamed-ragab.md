Mohamed Abdulla joined the team and competed in EVER18 at the very beginning, and it was Arrow's first competition. His role was the brakes (together with his other teammates).

He also competed in SEM19 (and that is when he earned the golden member title, but more about that later); his role was bigger this time, which is the wheel assembly. He was introduced to many other design and manufacturing challenges In the wheel assembly team he was responsible for the brakes and the assembly of the vehicle “tires and rims” with the chassis, an assembly that requires a mechanical solution that is immune to wear and will carry the vehicle loads on its 4 wheels. EVER19 was his third contribution (EVER is the Egyptian regional Competition, where we competed with ART02), and his role was the wheel assembly and the fiberglass body of the vehicle along with some driver vision ergonomics, and he wasn’t only giving a year of experience in this car, but also teaching new members how to plan, think and design. He successfully brought a full design and manufacturing for hub motors wheel assembly and a good looking body with a drag of 0.4 as the vehicle is required to go at high speeds. It took him and his team a lot of work to come up with a good finish that year.

In his fourth contribution, the current season, he is giving a great contribution to the Wheel assembly of the vehicle (ART03 which is meant to be competing in SEM20, and his graduation project) and this year he brought (together with his fellow teammates Kerolos Tharwat and Ahmed Sayed) a wheel assembly design that is a result of an accumulated two years of experience. Also, he is a member of the more advanced and lighter in the weight steering system (wire steering) that will involve an autonomous controlling motor for the lane-keep assist that ART03 will be providing.
