Eman Essam joined the team in 2018, back when the team was shaping and in the first competition EVER18 (the regional competition in Egypt). Her technical role was the vehicle wiring together with the safety and shutdown circuitry but not only that, she was also one of the team's backbones and still, that is by committing herself and giving her time to the team by helping in many different non-technical roles.

The second competition was SEM19 (Shell Eco-Marathon 2019, and that is when she earned the golden member title, but more about that later) and her role was the Embedded systems of the vehicle and the vehicle wiring together with her teammate Mohamed Mesbah. In that season, she gained a lot of practical experience in her field and the team made its greatest achievements by successfully passing the technical and safety inspections of Shell Eco-Marathon.
