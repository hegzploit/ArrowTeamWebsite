Kerolos Tharwat joined the team and competed in EVER19 (Local Competition in Egypt, where we competed with ART02) and his role was the Wheel Assembly of the vehicle, together with the other teammates. He successfully brought a full design and manufacturing, assembling a couple of hub motors as rear wheels and a front freewheels. It took him and his team a lot of work to come up with a good finish.

In the second (the current) season, he is giving a great contribution to the suspension of the vehicle (ART03 which is supposed to be competing in SEM20, and his graduation project) working with his fellow teammate Ahmed Waleed. Also, he is a member of the wheel assembly team (just like the previous year) and this time he is giving his accumulated experience by bringing a very light and efficient assembly for the wheels. As a team, we appreciate your support and wishing for more!
