Mohamed A.Tawfik joined the team and competed in EVER19 (Local Competition in Egypt, where we competed with ART02) and his role was the wiring and the vehicle embedded systems, together with the other teammates. He successfully brought a full design for the wiring diagram and the software of the embedded systems used in the vehicle. It took him and his team a lot of work to come up with a good finish that year and it was a great success.

In the second (the current) season, he is giving a great contribution to the powertrain of the vehicle (ART03 which is meant to be competing in SEM20, and his graduation project) in which he learned how to build a full motor driver for a BLDC motor, by first building a model for motor selection and designing a schematic for the motor driver.
