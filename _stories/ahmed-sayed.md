Ahmed Sayed joined the team and competed in EVER18 at the very beginning when the team was starting. His role was the brakes (together with his other teammates). 

He also competed in SEM19 (and that is when he earned the golden member title, but more about that later); his role was bigger this time, which is the wheel assembly. He was introduced to many other design and manufacturing challenges In the wheel assembly team he was responsible for the brakes and the assembly of the vehicle "tires and rims" with the chassis, an assembly that requires a mechanical solution that is immune to wear and will carry the vehicle loads on its 4 wheels. 
EVER19 was his third contribution (EVER is a Local Competition in Egypt, where we competed with ART02), and his role was the wheel assembly of the vehicle, and he wasn't only giving a year of experience in this car, but also teaching new members how to plan, think and design. He successfully brought a full design and manufacturing for hub motors wheel assembly. It took him and his team a lot of work to come up with a good finish that year.
